Session folder for Felix bot

This folder stores runtime session data (auth files, pairing data, etc.).

- Keep sensitive session files out of version control; use `.env` to configure `SESSION_PATH`.
- `.env.sample` contains example environment variables.

If you want me to add a sample session file or change retention rules, tell me which format to use.do
